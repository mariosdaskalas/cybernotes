First, download the convert.py file. Run it with the folllowing command.

```shell
python3 convert.py
```

You are prompted with the following text.

If 15 is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?

Every decimal number has a representation in a binary form. For example, take the number 3, which is in the decimal format. In the binary form it is equal to '11'.

If you want to learn about this, I recommend look at the table below.

```shell
python3
print(bin(15)[2:])
```

The program above converts the decimal number '15' to it's binary representation. Enter that value as an answer to the convert.py file.

 Nice, you've got the flag!
