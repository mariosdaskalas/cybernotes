Hi, I'm Marios. I'm from Greece ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·.

Currently working as a Software Developer and MSc Cyber Security student @ [Leeds Beckett University](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

This is a personal blog, in which I will write stuff about Cyber Security, with topics such as _Penetration Testing_, _Bug Bounty_, [_Cryptography_](/cryptography), [_CTF_](/ctf) and more.
