Hi, I'm Marios. I'm from Greece ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·.

Currently working as a Software Developer and MSc Cyber Security student @ [Leeds Beckett University](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

This is a personal blog, in which I will write stuff about Cyber Security, with topics such as _Penetration Testing_, _Bug Bounty_, _Cryptography_, _CTF_ and more.

You can contact me via email [here](mailto:contact@cybernotes.uk).
